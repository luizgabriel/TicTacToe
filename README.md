# Tic Tac Toe Challenge - Bible Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe coding challenge for the Bible Project! This project is a fun and interactive way to demonstrate your coding skills using React Native.

### Design Decisions

1. The opponent's board is inverted for easier visualization from opposite positions.
2. The game supports grids larger than the standard 3x3 (like 5x5), maintaining all game logic and mechanics.
3. All game mechanics are well unit-tested.
